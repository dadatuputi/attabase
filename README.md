Source code for attaBase, an Android DoD Base Directory

## attaBase Background
I worked on this project as an undergraduate at Brigham Young University. The purpose was simple: learn Android while creating something that might be useful. 

It is currently published on the Play store.

I decided to release the source code for this app to help other developers see how a simple Android app might look. This was the first app I ever wrote, and was an excellent project to learn how to code in Java and Android specifically.

Feel free to go through the source code and learn from the good and the bad. If you use parts of this code, please just give me attribution.
